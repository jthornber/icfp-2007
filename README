Here's the code I wrote whilst trying to save Endo.  Alas I didn't.
Poor Endo.

It's a bit complicated to use:

* build dna2rna

   cabal configure
   cabal build

* run specifying a prefix on the command line

   ./dist/build/dna2rna/dna2rna "" < dna/endo.dna  > out.rna

* build rna2gbc (gbc = graphics bytecode)

   make rna2gbc

* run rna2gbc

   ./rna2gbc +RTS -K100M < out.rna > out.gbc

* build draw

   make draw

* run draw, this will produce out.raw (hard coded)

   ./draw out.gbc

* Use image magic to convert to something you can actually view

  ./raw2png out.raw

This produces out.raw.png, finally something you can view.
